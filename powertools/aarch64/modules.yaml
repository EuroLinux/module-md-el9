  summary: Connects C/C++/Objective C to some high-level programming languages
  description: >
    Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a software development tool
    for connecting C, C++ and Objective C programs with a variety of high-level programming
    languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common
    scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list
    of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go
    language, Java including Android, Lua, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and R. Also several
    interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported.
    SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
    environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
    software
